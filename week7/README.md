# Outline

We will develop a website that can be used to manage the catalog for a local library.

We will:

- Use the _Express Application Generator_ tool to create a skeleton website and application.
- Start and stop the Node web server.
- Use a database to store your application's data.
- Create routes for requesting different information, and templates ("views") to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser.
- Work with forms.
- Deploy our application to production.
