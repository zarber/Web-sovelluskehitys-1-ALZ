## Part 1: Git Visualizer

https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/

Spend some time experimenting with branches and how you they work to clarify your understanding.

Note that this website doesn't understand `git switch`, so you'll need to run `git checkout` to switch branches (e.g. `git checkout mybranch` to switch to `mybranch`), and `git checkout -b` to make branches (e.g. `git checkout -b add-story` to make a new branch named `add-story`)!

Please refer to the following animation or use the git commands below:

![Animation](git-vis.gif 'Branching')

```bash
git commit -m "added part 1"
git commit -m "added part 2"
git commit -m "added part 3"
git branch feature1
git checkout feature1
git commit -m "added part 4"
git checkout master
git commit -m "added part 5"
```

## Part 2: Git Branches

### Working with Git Branches

In Git, a `branch` is a new/separate version of the main repository.

Let's say you have a large project, and you need to update the design on it.

How would that work without and with Git:

Without Git:

- Make copies of all the relevant files to avoid impacting the live version
- Start working with the design and find that code depend on code in other files, that also need to be changed!
- Make copies of the dependant files as well. Making sure that every file dependency references the correct file name
- EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
- Save all your files, making a note of the names of the copies you were working on
- Work on the unrelated error and update the code to fix it
- Go back to the design, and finish the work there
- Copy the code or rename the files, so the updated design is on the live version
- (2 weeks later, you realize that the unrelated error was not fixed in the new design version because you copied the files before the fix)

With Git:

- With a new branch called new-design, edit the code directly without impacting the main branch
- EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
- Create a new branch from the main project called small-error-fix
- Fix the unrelated error and merge the small-error-fix branch with the main branch
- You go back to the new-design branch, and finish the work there
- Merge the new-design branch with main (getting alerted to the small error fix that you were missing)

Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.

When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.

You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.

Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!

### New Git Branch

Let add some new features to our `index.html` page.

We are working in our local repository, and we do not want to disturb or possibly wreck the main project.

So we create a new `branch`:

```bash
    git branch hello-world-images
```

Now we created a new `branch` called "`hello-world-images`"

Let's confirm that we have created a new `branch`:

```bash
    git branch
      hello-world-images
    * main
```

We can see the new branch with the name "hello-world-images", but the `*` beside `main` specifies that we are currently on that `branch`.

`checkout` is the command used to check out a `branch`. Moving us **from** the current `branch`, **to** the one specified at the end of the command:

```bash
    git checkout hello-world-images
    Switched to branch 'hello-world-images'
```

Now we have moved our current workspace from the main branch, to the new `branch`

> With the release of Git 2.23, its developers introduced new git command: git switch and git restore. The idea behind this move is to let people use git switch for switching branches and git restore for undoing changes from a commit.

Let's add an image (img_hello_world.jpg) to the working folder and a line of code in the `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="bluestyle.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <div>
      <img
        src="img_hello_world.jpg"
        alt="Hello World from Space"
        style="width:100%;max-width:960px"
      />
    </div>
    <p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>
    <p>A new line in our file!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

We have made changes to a file and added a new file in the working directory (same directory as the `main` `branch`).

Now check the status of the current `branch`:

```bash
    git status
    On branch hello-world-images
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add ..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore ..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   index.html

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
            img_hello_world.jpg

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

So let's go through what happens here:

- There are changes to our index.html, but the file is not staged for `commit`
- `img_hello_world.jpg` is not `tracked`

So we need to add both files to the Staging Environment for this `branch`:

```bash
    git add --all
```

Using `--all` instead of individual filenames will **Stage** all changed (new, modified, and deleted) files.

Check the `status` of the `branch`:

```bash
    git status
    On branch hello-world-images
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git restore --staged ..." to unstage)
        new file: img_hello_world.jpg
        modified: index.html
```

We are happy with our changes. So we will commit them to the `branch`:

```bash
    git commit -m "Added image to Hello World"
    [hello-world-images 0312c55] Added image to Hello World
    2 files changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 img_hello_world.jpg
```

Now we have a new `branch`, that is different from the main `branch`.

**Note:** Using the `-b` option on `checkout` will create a new branch, and move to it, if it does not exist

### Switching Between Branches

Now let's see just how quick and easy it is to work with different branches, and how well it works.

We are currently on the branch `hello-world-images`. We added an image to this branch, so let's list the files in the current directory:

```bash
    ls
    README.md  bluestyle.css  img_hello_world.jpg  index.html
```

We can see the new file `img_hello_world.jpg`, and if we open the html file, we can see the code has been altered. All is as it should be.

Now, let's see what happens when we change branch to `main`

```bash
    git checkout main
    Switched to branch 'main'
```

The new image is not a part of this branch. List the files in the current directory again:

```bash
    ls
    README.md  bluestyle.css  index.html
```

`img_hello_world.jpg` is no longer there! And if we open the html file, we can see the code reverted to what it was before the alteration.

See how easy it is to work with branches? And how this allows you to work on different things?

### Emergency Branch

Now imagine that we are not yet done with hello-world-images, but we need to fix an error on main.

I don't want to mess with main directly, and I do not want to mess with hello-world-images, since it is not done yet.

So we create a new branch to deal with the emergency:

```bash
    git checkout -b emergency-fix
    Switched to a new branch 'emergency-fix'
```

Now we have created a new branch from main, and changed to it. We can safely fix the error without disturbing the other branches.

Let's fix our imaginary error:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="bluestyle.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>
    <p>This line is here to show how merging works.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

We have made changes in this file, and we need to get those changes to the main branch.

Check the status:

```bash
    git status
    On branch emergency-fix
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add ..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore ..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   index.html

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

stage the file, and commit:

```bash
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "updated index.html with emergency fix"
    [emergency-fix dfa79db] updated index.html with emergency fix
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Now we have a fix ready for main, and we need to merge the two branches.
