## Task

- Create a Git repo (`git init`)
- Create `README.md` and `.gitignore` files _before_ the first commit
- Choose files for the commit: `git add .` (`.` means all files in current folder recursively)
- Check always with `git status` that your are not going to commit anything unnecessary. Fix your `.gitignore` if needed
- Create an initial commit: `git commit -m "Initial, added readme and .gitignore"` (a good commit message always describes what changes you have done after the previous commit)
- Create a new project in GitHub and push your local repo there: `git remote add origin <YOUR_URL>`, `git push -u origin [main/master]`
- What is the output of this command `git remote -v`
- If you have have problems with GitHub authentication, you can check the following links:
