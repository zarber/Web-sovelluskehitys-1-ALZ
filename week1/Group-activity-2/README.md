## Tasks

> Work in group to solve these tasks.

## Task 1

- Difference between [V8](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)>) and [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) - The difference between V8 and SpiderMonkey is compilation. SpiderMonkey compiles JavaScript to an intermediate language which is interpreted. V8 differs by compiling JavaScript to machine instructions, eliminating a need for an interpreter. Spidermonkey  and V8  are very similar in the core javascript engine API in that both try to be standards compliant.

- Difference between [V8](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)>) and [Blink](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)>) - V8 is JavaScript engine and Blink is browser engine. 

## Task 2

The function `min(a,b)` in `script.js` should return the least of two numbers a and b. For instance:

```js
min(2, 5); // returns 2
min(3, -1); // returns-1
min(1, 1); // returns 1
```

- Fix the code

## Task 3

The node command is the one we use to run our Node.js scripts:

```bash
node script.js
```

If we run the node command without any script to execute or without any arguments, we start a REPL session:

```bash
node
```

- Use REPL to calculate `(413/2)+(14\*6)`

## Task 4

Create a folder `task4`. In the folder create file `script.js` that logs `This is JavaScript` to console, and run it.
